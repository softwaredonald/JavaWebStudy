    <h1>Peter Dutton resigns ministerial position after leadership challenge</h1>
        2019-3-11 1:01 eoi encrypton
        He put his hand up to lead the party after Mr Turnbull declared the leadership position vacant this morning.

        While Mr Turnbull won the spill by 48 votes to 35, it’s unlikely the vote will settle the matter.
        
        Mr Dutton indicated as much after the vote, resigning his position as minister to sit on the backbench.
        
        This will give Mr Dutton the freedom to lobby for more support from his colleagues and to criticise decisions of the Cabinet.
        
        After the leadership spill, Sky News Australia reporter Ashleigh Gillon said “it’s not over” and noted that Mr Turnbull had only won the ballot by seven votes.
        
        If successful, Mr Dutton would be Australia’s sixth prime minister in 11 years.
        
        However, Mr Dutton does have his challenges, including doubt over whether he has a right to sit in parliament.
        
        According to Ten Eyewitness News, Mr Dutton could be disqualified from parliament as two child care centres he owns via a trust have been receiving direct subsidies from the government. Parliamentarians are not allowed to have any direct or indirect pecuniary interests with the Public Service of the Commonwealth.
        
        It was the same rule that brought down Family First Senator Bob Day last year.
        
        Mr Dutton will also have to face accusations that he is a puppet of former prime minister Tony Abbott and is also a figure not familiar to many Australians.
